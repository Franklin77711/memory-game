#Dota 2 Memory Game with React. 

##This is my first React application. 
The goal is to reach the maximum points(12) by clickin on the charachters without repeating your self. 

---------------------- 
1. I made the card data JS ./src/Components/CardsData.js its an array for 12 cards 
2. Made the skeleton of my project and added CSS 
3. Made it functional 
    a. Score.js only renders the score board 
    b. Cards.js renders the cards and their functionality 
    c. App.js renders everything together. 

---------------------- 
With this project I've learned how to work with components. 
How to pass attributes, basic of structuring my application. 
How state works with functional components. 
---------------------- 
ps: I might add more functionality later on.
